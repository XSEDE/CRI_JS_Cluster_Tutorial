# Openstack Cluster Building Tutorial Material

This directory contains example slides, and the Markdown walkthrough intended to guide
users through building a cluster on existing machines.

The slides are in two parts: an initial piece explaining some basics about HPC and the Openstack 
cloud used to deliver this (Jetstream, an XSEDE resource), and a second part going into more
detail about the SLURM resource manager, environment modules, and the Spack software build system.

The material in Walkthrough.md is best viewed in a browser.
